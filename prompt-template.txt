# Audio Visualizer Request Template

I'm using a JavaScript canvas-based audio visualization framework that provides these key features:

## Core Functions
- `audiohz(freq)`: Returns amplitude (0-1) at specified frequency
- `glowStart(color, size)` / `glowEnd()`: Add glow effects
- Global `time` variable for animations (seconds elapsed)
- Canvas dimensions available as `width` and `height`

## Available Visualizer Building Blocks:
```javascript
// Basic Drawing
circle(x, y, radius, outline?)           // Draw circle
line(x1, y1, x2, y2)                    // Draw line
fill(r, g, b, alpha?)                   // Set fill color
stroke(r, g, b, alpha?)                 // Set stroke color
lineWidth(width)                        // Set line width

// Effects
glowStart(color, size)                  // Start glow effect
glowEnd()                              // End glow effect
motionBlurStart(alpha, composite)       // Start motion blur
motionBlurEnd()                        // End motion blur
```

## Example Structure:
```javascript
const settings = {
    settings1: 0,
    settings2: 2
}

function setup()
{
    loadAudio("audio.mp3");
    playAudio();
}

function draw(time) {
    // Clear previous frame
    clear();
    
    // Get audio data
    const bassAmplitude = audiohz(60);  // Low frequencies
    const midAmplitude = audiohz(500);  // Mid frequencies
    const highAmplitude = audiohz(2000); // High frequencies
    
    // Draw visualization
    // Your visualization code here
}
```

## My Request:
I want to create a visualizer that [describe your desired visualization]. The visualization should react to [specify which frequencies] and should [describe the desired behavior/effect].

Key elements I want to include:
1. [List specific visual elements]
2. [List audio reactive behaviors]
3. [List any special effects desired]

Please generate the code using this framework's functions.





Can you look at the keywords and interpreter and this prompt tempate, and make some audio visualizers for me? 
Keywords holds extra visualizers etc you may be able to use instead of recreating any you might need.
