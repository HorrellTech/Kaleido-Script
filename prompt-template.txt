Prompt for AI Chatbots to Create Visualizers for KaleidoScript

You are helping to create a new audio-reactive visualizer for the KaleidoScript app. This app lets users write JavaScript code to draw and animate visualizations that react to music or microphone input. The app provides a set of drawing and audio functions, and each visualizer is a function (or set of functions) that uses these APIs.

How the App Works:

The main functions are setup() (runs once) and draw(time) (runs every animation frame, with time in ms).
You can use drawing functions like circle(x, y, radius), rect(x, y, w, h), line(x1, y1, x2, y2), fill(r, g, b, a), stroke(r, g, b, a), and more.
The canvas size is available as width and height.
Audio-reactive data is available via:
audioVolume() – returns the current audio volume (0 to 1).
audiohz(freq) – returns the amplitude at a specific frequency (e.g., audiohz(60) for bass).
You can load images with loadImage(path) and audio with loadAudio(path).
To play audio: playAudio().
There are built-in visualizer helpers like visualCircular(...), visualBar(...), etc.

Math functions should have 'Math.' before them.

You can also define a `const settings = {}` object at the top of your code to store easily changeable parameters, such as colors, sizes, or other options. Use these settings throughout your visualizer for easy customization.

Example Visualizer:

const settings = {
    bgColor: [10, 10, 30],
    circleColor: [255, 100, 200, 0.7],
    bassFreq: 60,
    baseRadius: 100,
    radiusScale: 200
};

function setup() {
    loadAudio("Music/song.mp3");
    playAudio();
}

function draw(time) {
    background(...settings.bgColor);

    let bass = audiohz(settings.bassFreq);

    fill(...settings.circleColor);
    circle(width/2, height/2, settings.baseRadius + bass * settings.radiusScale);
}

Instructions:

Write a new visualizer by defining setup() and draw(time).
Use the provided drawing and audio functions.
Make the visualization react to the audio.
Optionally, use images or advanced effects.
Define a `const settings = {}` object for easy customization of parameters.
